# The **SOURCE TOOLS**

## What are these for?

It's quite **complicated** at first,
but it's just *automation* at it's finest.

Although some of these might be "*why tf is this here*",
it's just for *convenience* if you can stand my **slop** *code*.

There's a **lot** of *things* here to help you!

### These include

- A compile script

> For your distrubution needs!

- Save remover

> Remember to do this since you might leak your saves lol

- And a reformatter!

> Cause I suck at programming, though idk if you'll need this
> Though please run this before a pull request, it'd be awful
> to reformat your ass code too.

## What do I need?

For now it only needs **1 external python module.**
As for compiling it needs *PyInstaller*.

It should be *easy* nonetheless, as installing it should be no deal.

For **MacOS** and **Windows**:

> Pretty simple.

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
```

For externally managed **Linux** systems:
> Use a virtual Python environment.
> I recommend putting it in this directory!

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

> Activate it of course

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

> Then install via pip

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
```
