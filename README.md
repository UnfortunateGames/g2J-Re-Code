A CLI Python game I'm working on.

A game where ~~God~~ guides you on your way to salvation!
Do tasks, hunt and eat for food.
Just don't make ~~God~~ angry!

## ANNOUNCEMENTS

This will now be the *official* **go 2 JAMBOREE** code base.
The last version will be archived.

## How to Run

### Requirements

- Python > v3.13

> Based on when I updated it.
> This might get outdated fast, but i doubt it.

### For Developers

- PyInstaller (To compress it to a directory or .exe file)

> To read the Python code from source, read the doc. (Yes I know it's not implemented in yet)
> Or if you're a huge chad just read the doc strings instead.

*If running from source, please follow the instructions below in each specified platform.*

### Windows

Simply double-click or *"run"* the *runGame.bat* file in the root directory or either run below:

```sh
./runGame.bat
```

### Linux / MacOS

To run the game in your terminal, follow these instructions:

Set directory to the repository:

```sh
cd g2J-Re-Code
```

Then run the *shell* file:

```sh
./runGame.sh
```

**If it doesn't run**, then run this command on the *runGame* shell file:

```sh
chmod +x ./runGame.sh
```

If downloading from releases, please select the specified platform package from there.
No need for any special run cases.

## How to play

### 1. Do your tasks

In the altar you have to **ask**  before doing the task, *he* will guide you how.

### 2. Survive

You can get food by the lake, or the forest entrance!
Or if you really dare. Hunt the animals for better food!

### ~~3. escape~~

~~you will be ##@^#*&$#.~~

## For developers

If you want to modify the game or *maybe* fix the game bugs yourself.
Simply download the source code.
Or if you're a **giant** *nerd*, clone the repo via terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UnfortunateGames/g2J-Re-Code.git
```

And just set your directory to the repo

Now for redistribution compile it using the source tool "compile".
This will compile a single executable on the out directory.
Though you need PyInstaller for this.

> For Windows

```sh
./source-tools/compile.bat
```

> For Linux Systems / MacOS Systems

```sh
./source-tools/compile.sh
```

For instructions on how to install PyInstaller
Refer to the README of source-tools

## Modifying the source code

It's your choice! And I don't care what you'd do with it.
If you can bear my stupid code that is.

It'd be my pleasure to get some requests for some bugs in the game.
